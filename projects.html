          <br/><br/>
          This is my current exciting side project: <a href="http://savageevan.com">Evan</a> and I are working to make learning an integral and fun part of travel by building a StackOverflow-style Q&amp;A community where the questions are quests and can only be answered by journeying to new locales.  Maybe you want to see some examples of mythological symbolism in Zen gardens, but can't go to Japan yourself.  You can set up a quest for someone to find them for you.  Maybe you are in Japan and have no particular plans for your trip.  You happen to notice an open quest about Zen gardens and think it's interesting, so you decide to sniff around on the scribe's behalf, sending back photos and a description to report what you've learned and collect your reward.

          For our wedding on April 1, 2012, <a href="http://savageevan.com">Evan</a> and I decided in typical California style to DIY as much as possible.  This meant that we each made our outfits (my <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KcGGYPbLUMA/UI3GDUr5SvI/AAAAAAAAohc/oEthmsGypnA/s800/valkyrie%2520hella%2520skeptical.jpg">dress</a> and his <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Fiz4wCIVYaM/UI3FA6AZDbI/AAAAAAAAoaI/FK8ARuhjVao/s640/P40140515738933144793179721.jpg">jacket and vest</a>), we fabricated our rings (he made <a href="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/532949_10150787691934136_1558741077_n.jpg">mine</a> in the old way using a silver bar and a forge, and I made <a href="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/532949_10150787691934136_1558741077_n.jpg">his</a> in the new way using a 3D printer), we brewed our beer (<a href="">CAST IRON RED</a>, <a href="">HEFE BURBUJAS</a>, and <a href="">DEEP STORAGE PORTER</a>), we wrote our <a href="http://github.com/valkyriesavage/tost-vows">vows</a>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          For bonus points, since we're both nerds, we built soft electronics into my dress that would sense how close we are together using a pair of XBEE radios and light some number of LEDs accordingly.  We also rented <a href="http://www.mexicanbus.net">the Mexican party bus</a> (which I highly recommend) and performed a moving rendition of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avaSdC0QOUM">I'm on a Boat</a> while popping actual <a href="http://www.snooth.com/wine/mumm-napa-champagne-blend-napa-valley-dvx-santana-1999/">Santana Champ</a>, which you can buy in Napa.

          <br/><br/>
          H2O IQ is a smart watering system hooked into a drip irrigation system.  It includes an in-garden moisture monitoring device and a web interface.  The in-garden device's moisture sensor is built of two nails submerged in plaster; the plaster absorbs water similarly to a plant's stem so this is an effective method of measurement.  The device also contains a servo which it uses to control water flow through the drip irrigation system.  Finally, the device also has a simple on-board microcontroller and XBee radio which it uses to update a server's record of its moisture as well as to query the server for optimal or desired watering settings.
          <br/><br/>
          This project was built as a part of Bjoern Hartmann's <a href="http://husk.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/cs294-84-fall12/index.php/Main_Page">inaugural interactive device design class</a> in Fall 2012, and it was simulated in a scaled up version as part of <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~kubitron/cs262/">Kubi's CS262A course</a> in the same semester.

          <h2>Volunteerism</h2>
          <h3>BiD Seminars</h3>
          I'm the organizer of the weekly <a href="http://bid.berkeley.edu">Berkeley Institute of Design</a> seminars.  You can get on our <a href="https://calmail.berkeley.edu/manage/list/listinfo/bid-lab@lists.berkeley.edu">email list</a> if you're interested in getting announcements, or feel free to email me if you'd like to speak!
          <h3>BASIS</h3>
          Bay Area Scientists in Schools is a program where the science-inclined can spend an hour in an elementary school classroom once per month (or more often) and teach kids science through hands-on activities.  <a href="http://savageevan.com">Evan</a> and I have written a couple of lesson plans for this, but haven't had a chance to try them out yet...
          <h3>Berkeley CSGSA</h3>
          As the outdoor events coordinator and one of the social coordinators for the CSGSA at Berkeley, I am partially responsible for ensuring that grad students maintain some kind of work/life balance.  :)  I have run events like
          <ul>
            <li>Biking across the Golden Gate Bridge</li>
            <li>Monthly international movie night</li>
            <li>A skiing trip to Tahoe with the EEGSA</li>
            <li>Board games night</li>
          </ul>
          Incidentally, if you are interested in hosting a movie night or have an idea for an event, contact me!
          <h3>Acting</h3>
          I've done some acting in my time, much of it in Spanish.  I haven't had a chance to find a good group to work with around Berkeley yet, though, so if you hear of one, let me know!
