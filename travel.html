          <a href="http://savagevan.com">Evan</a> and I are currently on our adventure in Southeast Asia.  We started with just two tickets to Cairns, Australia, and are planning to hop north along Indonesia and the coast towards China---as far as we can get in 3 months before my courses start again in the fall.

          We finally knocked off the last western European country on our lists: Luxembourg.  As a special deviation after <a href="http://acm.org/chi/chi2013">CHI 2013</a>, we rented a car and drove both to get information from some distant relatives of mine in Metz, France, and to explore this tiny and improbable-seeming country.

          For a ridiculous New Year's Eve, we decided to run a 5k in the dark Toronto snow.  The next morning, we set out on a quest to visit the <a href="http://momath.org">Museum of Mathematics</a>, newly opened in New York City.  We stopped by Montreal and Boston on the way, and took time to visit the <a href="?">Makerbot Flagship Store</a> in NYC, too.  For research purposes, you understand.

          We hiked down the Grand Canyon to the bottom on New Year's Eve and emerged on New Year's Day.  We carried a bottle of champagne with us down to the bottom, much to the amusement of the other folks staying in our campground.  While in the area, we crossed off such bucket list items as flying in a hot air balloon.

          We actually ran a marathon.  After training for some months with our friends, we decided to use the purchase of racing tickets as a forcing function that would convince us to do it.  So, we flew to Salt Lake City and ran through the Little Grand Canyon amid fossilized dinosaur footprints and petroglyphs.

          With ~40 lbs. of luggage each and an absurd dream to bike at least 10,000 km, <a href="http://savageevan.com">Evan</a> and I set out on a cycling trip from Copenhagen to Portugal via Istanbul.  It was a chance to find ourselves (and each other) after completing our bachelors' degrees and before setting into the "real world".  We discovered the incredible depths of human kindness and our own tenacity.

          While I lived in Geneva working for CERN, I had the opportunity to visit several places I'd missed during my time in Germany.  I began preparing for the bike trip with my meagre 10km commute every morning.  I did the bungee jump from the opening sequence of Goldeneye...

          We had some money left after working for Google, so <a href="http://savageevan.com">Evan</a> and I decided that we should head to Japan.  This destination was literally chosen via the Python utility random.choice in a contest between, I believe, it, Brazil, and Madagascar.
